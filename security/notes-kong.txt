Configuring a service

curl --request DELETE --url localhost:8001/routes/rules-route
curl --request DELETE --url localhost:8001/services/rules-api

curl --request DELETE --url localhost:8001/routes/reports-route
curl --request DELETE --url localhost:8001/services/reports-api

- Step1: Add a service (la url debe ser la del container)

curl -i -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/services --data name=rules-cmd-api --data 'url=http://172.20.0.2:5000/'
curl -i -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/services --data name=rules-qry-api --data 'url=http://172.20.0.3:5000/'

curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/services/rules-qry-api
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/services/rules-cmd-api

curl --request PATCH --url localhost:8001/services/rules-cmd-api --data retries=6
curl --request PATCH --url localhost:8001/services/rules-cmd-api --data 'url=http://127.0.0.1:5000/'
curl --request PATCH --url localhost:8001/services/rules-cmd-api --data 'url=http://172.20.0.4:5000/'


- Step2: Add a route

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/rules-cmd-api/routes --data 'paths[]=/rules-cmd' --data name=rules-cmd-ruta
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/rules-qry-api/routes --data 'paths[]=/rules-qry' --data name=rules-qry-ruta

curl --request PATCH --url localhost:8001/services/rules-cmd-api/routes/rules-cmd-ruta --data tags="tutorial1"
curl --request PATCH --url localhost:8001/services/rules-qry-api/routes/rules-qry-ruta --data tags="tutorial2"

curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8001/routes/rules-cmd-ruta
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8001/routes/rules-qry-ruta


- Call the API directly

# curl -i http://172.20.0.2:5000/


- Call the API behind kong

curl -i http://localhost:8000/rules-cmd/rules
curl -i http://localhost:8000/rules-cmd/check

curl -i http://localhost:8000/rules-qry/rules
curl -i http://localhost:8000/rules-qry/check

curl -i -X GET --url http://127.0.0.1:8000/rules-cmd/check
curl -i -X GET --url http://127.0.0.1:8000/rules-qry/check

JWT
===

A JWT has a data payload signed by a trusted party to prevent spoofing. An authorizer verifies 
that the JWT token is authentic, allowing (or forbidding) access to that resource. 
Typically, a JWT payload is not encrypted; it’s open for the whole world to read. However, 
what’s critical is the authenticity of a token, which depends on a trusted party signing it.

As more companies move from monolithic systems to microservices, a decoupled front-line API gateway 
to those services — providing authentication, traffic control, request and response transformation — 
becomes increasingly crucial. Kong Gateway, which is open source, serves as that thin layer between 
your users and your upstream microservices.

In this approach, the plugin serves as the JWT authorizer. It authenticates the JWT in the HTTP request 
by verifying that token’s claims and ensuring a trusted party signed it. Then, depending on whether 
these steps were successful, Kong Gateway routes the upstream service request.

Basic JWT and API Gateway Use Case

In this basic use case, I have a login server that accepts login attempts with a user’s email and password. 
If the email/password checks out, the server generates and signs a JWT and hands it back to the user.

With JWT in hand, the user tries to access our microservice: a simple API server with a single endpoint. Kong Gateway 
sits in front of your API server, using the JWT plugin for authentication. The user presents his JWT with his request.

First, the plugin verifies the token’s authenticity. Next, it confirms the installation steps of the claims 
inside the payload. A common claim used is an expiration timestamp for the access token. It’s essentially saying, 
“This token is valid until this date and time.” So, the plugin will check the token’s expiration date.

If the JWT passes all the necessary checks, Kong Gateway grants access to the requested server endpoint. Otherwise, 
it responds with 401 Unauthorized.

The approach to JWT authentication is quite simple:

- Set up a basic Node.js Express server with a single endpoint.
- Set up Kong Gateway as an API gateway to your server.
- Enable the JWT plugin to protect your server endpoint with JWT authentication.
Lastly, I’ll cover advanced use cases for the plugin. Ready to dive in to our JWT Authentication Tutorial? Here we go!



OAuth2
======


What Is OAuth2 Authorization?
OAuth2 is an authorization protocol that enables two unrelated services to share resources. 

Here’s an example that explains the fundamental concepts of OAuth:
Meet Clark. Clark got a shiny, new pedometer for his birthday, and he has an account with Step On (stepon.me) 
to track his daily step count. Step On stores some information for Clark — his user profile, biometric data and daily step count.

In OAuth terminology, Clark is the resource owner, and his resources (user profile, biometric data and daily 
step count) are held by Step On, the resource server.

Clark also has an account with Shoe Fly Shoe (shoeflyshoe.store), an online store that gives discounts when 
customers hit certain step counts. If any customers have an account with Step On, the store can connect to 
the customer’s Step On accounts to download those step counts automatically. Super convenient!

Shoe Fly Shoe is the client application, needing access to Clark’s resources at the resource server. For this 
to happen, Clark needs to let Step On know that he authorizes the store to access those resources.

The OAuth protocol negotiates this process. It starts when a resource owner authorizes a client application to 
access resources on the resources server. Upon authorization, the client application gets an authorization code 
and exchanges it for an access token and a refresh token. When the client application presents the access token 
to the authorization server, it essentially says, “Hey, remember me? I’m that application that Clark said would 
be allowed to access his stuff. Let me in, please.” After some time, the access token will expire. The client 
application presents the refresh token to the authorization server to request a new access token.
